# Agent workflow

Every task moves through the same four beats, each backed by a skill from
this collection (or installed alongside it — see [Skill sources](#skill-sources)).
Drop this file into a repo as `AGENTS.md` and fill in the repo-specific
callouts; it also governs work in this repo itself.

## Workflow

1. **Isolate — `/new-feature`.** Every new feature starts in a fresh Git
   worktree branched from `origin/main` so agents can work in parallel
   without conflicts. Never build on `main`.
2. **Build — `/code-structure`.** Write code to the service-layer
   architecture: actions/boundaries orchestrate the "why/when", a service
   layer owns the reusable "how", with explicit inputs and structured
   returns.
3. **Prove — `/evidence-driven-testing`.** Verify with the repo's checks
   plus runtime evidence. Capture the **before** state while reproducing the
   issue — prior to fixing it, when it is cheapest — and the **after** once
   the change works.
4. **Ship — `/before-and-after`, then `/greploop`.** Open the PR with
   before/after proof embedded in the description (screenshot or video
   whenever the change has a visible surface; measured numbers or output
   pairs when it doesn't). Run `/greploop` — or `/greploop-apps` when the PR
   exceeds Greptile's file-count limit — until Greptile reports **5/5 with
   zero unresolved comments**. Finish by presenting the PR URL.

Ship-beat notes:

- `/before-and-after` drives the `@vercel/before-and-after` CLI. `--markdown`
  uploads the pair and prints a PR-ready table; it also accepts existing
  PNGs, so evidence gathered while developing can be reused as-is.
- In containers/VMs where Chrome fails with "No usable sandbox", set
  `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS="--no-sandbox"` for the capture command.
- The default upload host (0x0.st) is public — fine for ordinary UI shots;
  pass `--upload-url` for anything sensitive.

## Evidence in PRs, never in the repo

Before/after screenshots, screen recordings, and any other visual proof
**belong in the PR description** (uploaded and embedded as image URLs /
markdown), **never as files in the repo**. The repo keeps code, not media.

- **Do not** commit `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webm`, `.mp4`,
  `.mov`, `.webp` files as part of a feature/fix PR — even when they
  illustrate the change. Upload them via the `before-and-after` markdown
  flow or another host, then attach the resulting links to the PR body.
- Keep raw captures under a gitignored folder (`.artifacts/`, `evidence/`,
  `screenshots/`, etc.) so they stay local for reuse but never reach git.
- When a screenshot absolutely must live next to source (e.g. a docs page
  that renders an image at build time, a fixture that the test suite reads),
  justify it in the PR description and confirm it is tracked in the repo's
  long-lived asset policy — this is the exception, not the rule.
- The same applies to evidence-driven recordings (`evidence.mp4`,
  `report.md`, `manifest.json`): they are PR attachments, not commits.

## Multi-agent rules

- Never commit directly to `main`.
- One worktree and one branch per task and per agent — never reuse or modify
  another agent's worktree, branch, or uncommitted work.
- **Scope check** before starting: skim open PRs' changed files
  (`gh pr list`, `gh pr diff <n> --name-only`) and look for uncommitted work
  in shared checkouts. On overlap, stop and ask for direction.
- Never force-push to `main` — and never plain `--force` anywhere; only
  `--force-with-lease`, only on your own task branch.
- Resolve lockfile conflicts by regenerating, never by hand-merging.
- Worktrees don't isolate shared resources: confirm a dev-server port
  answers *your* process before trusting it, and don't run schema
  experiments against a shared database.
- If a conflict can't be resolved confidently, stop and report instead of
  guessing.

## Completing a task

1. Keep changes limited to the assigned task.
2. Run the repo's checks *(repo-specific: list the exact commands here)*.
3. Assemble the evidence captured along the way into before/after pairs.
4. Commit with a clear message, rebase onto the latest `origin/main`, and
   rerun the checks.
5. Push (`git push -u origin <branch>`; after rebasing an already-pushed
   branch, `--force-with-lease`).
6. Open the PR. The body must explain what changed, how it was tested (every
   claim backed by evidence), before/after proof, and any risks or follow-up
   work.
7. Run `/greploop` (or `/greploop-apps`) until **5/5 with zero unresolved
   comments**.
8. End by presenting the PR URL.

Do not merge the PR unless explicitly instructed. Keep the worktree until
the PR is merged or closed.

## Repo-specific sections to add

When dropping this file into a project, append what agents need to execute
the beats there: commands & checks, hard invariants (security and
architecture rules), an environment quick reference, local test
infrastructure (stubs, fixtures), and anything that can't be tested locally.
